"""Bandwidth-aware dataframe utilities inspired by RAPIDS.

Kernel: K003 - Columnar Sum Aggregation
========================================

Purpose:
    RAPIDS-inspired columnar aggregation. Computes column-wise sums over
    dataframe-like structures (dict of lists).

Expected Shapes/Dtypes:
    - Input: dict[str, list[float]] (column name → values)
    - Typical: 10-100 columns × 1,000-50,000 rows
    - Dtypes: float32, float64

Mathematical Summary:
    For each column C[col]: result[col] = Σ(C[col][i]) for all i
    Independent per-column reduction (embarrassingly parallel).

Performance (Baseline):
    - Small (10×1K): ~0.08ms, 128.5 M elem/s
    - Medium (50×10K): ~3.9ms, 128.4 M elem/s
    - Large (100×50K): ~40.7ms, 122.7 M elem/s

Performance (Optimized with NumPy):
    - Expected: 2-3× speedup via SIMD vectorization

Tiling Strategy:
    Current: NumPy vectorization per column
    Future: Parallel column processing with ThreadPoolExecutor

Optimization Applied:
    1. ✅ Use NumPy sum operations (vectorized SIMD)
    2. Future: Parallel column processing
    3. Future: GPU offload with CuPy

Test Status: ✅ Pass (via benchmark harness)

    Measured: NumPy path 4.5× slower (17.3ms vs 3.9ms on 50×10K workload)

    Python's built-in sum() is already optimized in CPython and performs well.
    Crossover point: Estimated >100K elements per column for NumPy to be beneficial.
    
    Future optimization: Accept NumPy arrays as input to avoid conversion,
    or use parallel processing for large tables (>1M elements).
