## 2. Tool Qualification Strategy

### 2.1 Qualification Approach

QuASIM tools follow the **Traditional Qualification** approach per DO-330 Section 2.3:

1. **Tool Operational Requirements** - Define intended use and functional requirements
2. **Tool Development Process** - Document development standards and practices
3. **Tool Validation** - Execute comprehensive validation procedures
4. **Tool Configuration Management** - Maintain version control and change management
5. **Tool Qualification Data** - Compile evidence package for certification authority

Alternative approaches (Tool Operational Requirements with Service History, or Tool Operational Requirements with Development Error Prevention) are not applicable as QuASIM tools are newly developed for aerospace certification.

### 2.2 Qualification Objectives

Per DO-330 Table A-2, the following qualification objectives apply:

| Objective | Description | Applicability |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **1** | Tool Operational Requirements are defined | All Tools |
| **2** | Tool development process includes standards | All Tools |
| **3** | Tool validation process is defined | All Tools |
| **4** | Tool validation procedures are executed | All Tools |
| **5** | Tool validation results are documented | All Tools |
| **6** | Tool configuration management is established | All Tools |
| **7** | Tool problem reporting is established | All Tools |
| **8** | Tool qualification data is provided | All Tools |

All objectives are satisfied through this qualification plan and supporting documentation.

### 2.3 Qualification Levels

Tools are classified by Tool Qualification Level (TQL) based on DO-330 Section 2.2 criteria:

- **TQL-1:** Tool output is part of airborne product, errors undetected
- **TQL-2:** Tool automates verification, errors fail to detect product errors
- **TQL-3:** Tool generates data for certification objectives
- **TQL-4:** Tool output used as specification or verification standard
- **TQL-5:** Tool does not meet TQL-1 through TQL-4 criteria (no qualification needed)

QuASIM tools are primarily TQL-2 (verification automation) and TQL-3 (certification data generation).

---

## 3. Tool Descriptions and Classifications

### 3.1 QuASIM Simulation Runtime

**Description:** Quantum circuit simulation engine with tensor network operations for digital twin modeling and trajectory optimization.

**Intended Use:** 
- Execute deterministic quantum simulations for verification activities
- Provide Monte Carlo trajectory analysis for certification evidence
- Support back-to-back comparison with analytical solutions

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-2** (Verification Automation)

**Rationale:** The runtime automates verification simulations. If the tool produces incorrect results, errors in the system under test could go undetected. The tool's output is used to verify compliance with requirements but does not become part of the certified product.

**Error Impact:** Incorrect simulation results could lead to accepting non-compliant designs or rejecting compliant designs, impacting certification decisions.

---

### 3.2 Monte Carlo Campaign Generator

**Description:** Statistical simulation campaign generator for trajectory analysis with fidelity and convergence reporting.

**Intended Use:**
- Generate Monte Carlo simulation campaigns (64-8192 trajectories)
- Compute statistical metrics (mean fidelity, confidence intervals)
- Provide certification evidence for system performance

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-3** (Data Generation)

**Rationale:** The generator produces statistical evidence submitted to certification authorities. While errors could affect evidence quality, the data is reviewed by V&V personnel and authorities before acceptance.

**Error Impact:** Incorrect statistics could misrepresent system performance, but errors would likely be detected during evidence review.

---

### 3.3 Seed Management System

**Description:** PRNG seed management system ensuring deterministic replay and validation.

**Intended Use:**
- Generate cryptographically secure seeds for simulations
- Enable deterministic replay for verification
- Maintain audit logs for traceability

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-2** (Verification Automation)

**Rationale:** Deterministic replay is essential for verification activities. If seeds fail to produce consistent results, verification processes could be invalidated.

**Error Impact:** Non-deterministic behavior would undermine verification credibility and certification confidence.

---

### 3.4 MC/DC Coverage Analyzer

**Description:** Modified Condition/Decision Coverage analyzer for test suite verification per DO-178C §6.4.4.

**Intended Use:**
- Compute MC/DC coverage for test suites
- Generate coverage matrices with traceability
- Verify 100% coverage for Level A certification

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-2** (Verification Automation)

**Rationale:** The analyzer automates structural coverage analysis required by DO-178C Level A. If the tool incorrectly reports coverage, inadequate testing could be accepted.

**Error Impact:** Incomplete coverage could result in untested code paths entering certified product.

---

### 3.5 Telemetry Ingestion Adapters

**Description:** Telemetry parsing and validation adapters for SpaceX and NASA data formats.

**Intended Use:**
- Parse SpaceX Falcon 9 telemetry (JSON format)
- Parse NASA Orion/SLS telemetry (CSV format)
- Validate schema compliance and convert to QuASIM format

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-4** (Input Processing)

**Rationale:** Adapters process input data for simulations but do not generate certification evidence directly. They serve as data preprocessing tools.

**Error Impact:** Parsing errors could lead to incorrect simulation inputs, but errors are typically detected by downstream validation checks.

---

### 3.6 Certification Artifact Generator

**Description:** Certification Data Package (CDP) generator for compliance documentation.

**Intended Use:**
- Compile verification evidence into CDP format
- Validate zero open anomalies before package generation
- Generate metadata and traceability information

**Tool Qualification Level:** **TQL-3** (Data Generation)

**Rationale:** The generator produces certification packages submitted to authorities. Errors could affect package completeness but would be detected during authority review.

**Error Impact:** Incomplete or incorrect packages would be rejected by certification authorities during review.

---

## 4. Tool Operational Requirements

Tool operational requirements are documented in **Tool_Operational_Requirements.md** (QA-DO330-TOR-001).

Key requirements categories include:

- **Functional Requirements** - Core capabilities and operations
- **Input Requirements** - Valid input specifications and validation
- **Output Requirements** - Output format and content specifications
- **Error Detection** - Error detection and reporting mechanisms
- **Environmental Requirements** - Hardware, software, and network dependencies

All tools shall meet the following cross-tool requirements:

- **OR-ALL-001:** Version reporting

## 5. Tool Validation Approach

### 5.1 Validation Strategy

Tool validation follows DO-330 Section 6 guidance with the following methods:

1. **Requirements-Based Testing** - Each operational requirement traced to validation test
2. **Back-to-Back Comparison** - Independent reference methods for verification
3. **Boundary Value Analysis** - Test operational limits and edge cases
4. **Error Injection** - Verify error detection mechanisms
5. **Regression Testing** - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

### 5.2 Validation Procedures

Validation procedures are documented in **Tool_Validation_Procedures.md** (QA-DO330-TVP-001).

Test procedures are identified as **TP-{TOOL}-{ID}**:

- **TP-SIM-001 to TP-SIM-005:** Simulation Runtime validation (5 procedures)
- **TP-MC-001 to TP-MC-004:** Monte Carlo Generator validation (4 procedures)
- **TP-SEED-001 to TP-SEED-003:** Seed Manager validation (3 procedures)
- **TP-COV-001 to TP-COV-002:** Coverage Analyzer validation (2 procedures)
- **TP-TEL-001 to TP-TEL-003:** Telemetry Adapters validation (3 procedures)
- **TP-CDP-001 to TP-CDP-002:** CDP Generator validation (2 procedures)

**Total:** 19 validation procedures

### 5.3 Validation Environment

Validation is performed in controlled environments:

- **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 8, macOS 11
- **Python:** 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **Hardware:** CPU-only and CUDA-enabled configurations
- **Test Framework:** pytest 7.x

All validation tests are automated and executed via:
```bash
python3 -m pytest test_quasim_validator.py -v
```

### 5.4 Validation Independence

Per DO-330 Section 6.5, validation is performed independently of tool development:

- **Development Team:** Implements tools and unit tests
- **V&V Team:** Executes validation procedures independently
- **QA Team:** Reviews validation evidence and approves qualification package

### 5.5 Acceptance Criteria

Tools are accepted when:

- All validation procedures pass (100% pass rate)
- All operational requirements verified
- Evidence documented and traceable
- No open problem reports (or accepted with rationale)
- Independent V&V review complete
