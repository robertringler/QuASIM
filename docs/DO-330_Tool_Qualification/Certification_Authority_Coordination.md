## 3. Tool Qualification Levels (TQL) Determination

### 3.1 TQL Assessment Process

Per DO-330 Section 2, tools are classified based on their output and error detection capability.

#### Decision Flow

1. **Can tool output introduce error into certified product?**
   - YES → **TQL-1** (Critical tool)
   - NO → Continue to step 2

2. **Does tool automate verification or detect errors?**
   - YES → **TQL-2** (Verification tool)
   - NO → Continue to step 3

3. **Does tool generate certification evidence?**
   - YES → **TQL-3** (Data generation tool)
   - NO → Continue to step 4

4. **Is tool output used as input to certified process?**
   - YES → **TQL-4** (Input/specification tool)
   - NO → **TQL-5** (No qualification required)

### 3.2 QuASIM Tool Classifications

## 11. Common Certification Authority Questions

### 11.1 Tool Classification Questions

**Q1: Why is QuASIM Simulation Runtime classified as TQL-2 instead of TQL-1?**

**A:** The runtime performs verification simulations but does not directly generate code or hardware that becomes part of the certified product. Its output is used to verify system behavior, making it a verification tool (TQL-2) rather than a development tool (TQL-1). Additionally, the runtime's outputs are independently verified through back-to-back testing with analytical solutions.

---

**Q2: Could errors in the Monte Carlo Generator go undetected and affect certification?**

**A:** The Monte Carlo Generator produces statistical evidence that is reviewed by V&V personnel and certification authorities. Any errors would be detected during evidence review. The generator does not automate pass/fail decisions; human review is required. Therefore, TQL-3 (data generation) is appropriate rather than TQL-2 (verification automation).

---

### 11.2 Validation Questions

**Q3: How is determinism verified across different operating systems and hardware?**

**A:** Determinism is verified through TP-SEED-003 (Replay Validation) which executes simulations with identical seeds on different platforms (Linux, macOS, CPU, GPU) and compares results. Timestamp drift is measured and must be < 1μs. Test results demonstrate determinism across Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 8, macOS 11, CPU-only, and CUDA configurations.

---

**Q4: What is the basis for the 99% schema validation threshold for telemetry adapters?**

**A:** The 99% threshold accounts for occasional malformed telemetry from real-world data sources (network errors, sensor glitches). Invalid telemetry is rejected and logged; it does not propagate into simulations. This threshold is consistent with industry practice for telemetry processing and was derived from analysis of historical telemetry error rates (typically < 0.5%).

---

### 11.3 Configuration Management Questions

**Q5: How are tool versions controlled and identified?**

**A:** All QuASIM tools include version identification in their output files and on startup. Version numbers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Git tags identify releases, and SHA hashes provide unique commit identification. Tool versions are recorded in certification packages, and only qualified versions are authorized for certification use.

---

**Q6: What triggers re-qualification of a tool?**

**A:** Re-qualification is required when:
- Tool operational requirements change
- Functional changes affect tool outputs
- New platforms or environments are supported
- Errors are discovered that affect previous certifications

Minor changes (documentation updates, non-functional improvements) do not require re-qualification but are tracked in configuration management.

## 12. Escalation Procedures

### 12.1 Technical Disagreements

If technical disagreements arise with certification authority:

1. **Document the Disagreement** - Capture issue, positions, and rationale
2. **Additional Analysis** - Provide supporting data, industry practices, standards
3. **Senior Review** - Escalate to senior authority personnel
4. **Alternative Approaches** - Propose compromise solutions
5. **Third-Party Expert** - Engage independent expert if needed

### 12.2 Schedule Impacts

If certification authority feedback impacts schedule:

1. **Assess Impact** - Quantify effort and schedule delay
2. **Prioritize Actions** - Critical path items first
3. **Resource Augmentation** - Add personnel if needed
4. **Parallel Paths** - Work multiple issues simultaneously
5. **Status Updates** - Frequent communication with authority

---

## 13. Lessons Learned and Best Practices

### 13.1 Successful Practices

1. **Early and Frequent Engagement** - Don't wait for complete package
2. **Clear Documentation** - Avoid jargon, use diagrams, provide examples
3. **Traceability** - Explicit links between requirements, tests, and evidence
4. **Transparency** - Disclose limitations and assumptions upfront
5. **Responsiveness** - Quick turnaround on feedback and clarifications

### 13.2 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Late Authority Involvement** - Leads to rework and schedule delays
2. **Incomplete Evidence** - Missing test logs or traceability gaps
3. **Ambiguous Requirements** - Non-testable or subjective requirements
4. **Configuration Control Gaps** - Uncontrolled tool versions
5. **Inadequate Documentation** - Assuming authority familiarity with tools

- **Parallel Activities** - Develop validation tests during requirements phase
- **Incremental Reviews** - Review tools individually rather than as a package
- **Pre-Qualified Tools** - Leverage tools already qualified on other programs
- **Dedicated Resources** - Full-time certification liaison

Minimum realistic timeline: **4-5 months** with aggressive schedule and responsive authority.
